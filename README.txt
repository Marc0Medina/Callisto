In each text file, there are lists containing relevant parameters (type, class, velocity, duration, place of origin, active region, time, and detection instrument) of Radio Bursts (RB), where the type corresponds to the name of each file.

In a Jupyter file (Eventos_ER-III.ipynb), the calculation of the velocity of type II solar radio bursts (SRB-II) is found, following the method given by Gopalswamy (2000), in Geophysical Monograph Series. In another Jupyter file, events of type III are plotted.

The data used was obtained from www.e-callisto.org. Those associated with flares were obtained from https://solarmonitor.org/. Data for Coronal Mass Ejections from https://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/.
